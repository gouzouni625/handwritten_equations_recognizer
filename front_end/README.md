This is an HTML-JavaScript application that you can use to draw your equations.
Concretely, this application uses the JavaScript Applet of GeoGebra software
on which you can draw your equation. After that, you can submit your equation
and the application will produce the corresponding InkML string. You can feed
this InkML string to the Handwritten Equation Recognizer and have your equation
recognized.
